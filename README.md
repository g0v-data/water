# Brief
The target of this reposiroy is to provide water statistics of Taiwan reservoir.

However, Taiwan Water Resource Agency doesn't provide RSS or other subscriptions to let you get the raw data.

I parse all the data from the earliest year (2003 ~) they have.

You can use it to do analysis or draw the trend diagram.
